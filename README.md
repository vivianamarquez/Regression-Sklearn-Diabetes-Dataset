# Data-Driven Insights into Diabetes Progression

**Jupyter Notebook with code, experimentation, further insights, and deployment strategies: [here](https://github.com/vivianamarquez/Regression-Sklearn-Diabetes-Dataset/blob/main/Regression_Example.ipynb).**

## Business Goal

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Managing and predicting diabetes progression can significantly improve patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency. The goal of this analysis is to develop predictive models that can forecast disease progression based on various medical and demographic features. This can help in identifying high-risk patients early and tailoring personalized treatment plans.

## Data

The diabetes dataset from `sklearn` contains ten baseline variables, all of which are numeric. The column **`target`** contains the target variable, which represents the measure of disease progression after one year. More info on this dataset: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes.html#sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes

## Modeling and performance

In this project, we employed various regression modeling techniques to predict diabetes progression using the diabetes dataset from `sklearn`. The models evaluated include `Linear Regression`, `Ridge Regression`, `Lasso Regression`, and `Elastic Net Regression`. Each model was trained and evaluated using a train/test split, followed by cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize performance. 

Among these, the Lasso Regression model demonstrated the best performance with a `Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 52.8980` and an` R-squared (R²) value of 0.4719`. That means that the model's prefictions are off by about 52..90 units from the actual values of diabetes progression andapproximately 47.19% of the variance in the disease progression is explained by the features in the model.

These metrics indicate that the Lasso Regression model provides a moderate level of accuracy in predicting diabetes progression, making it the most suitable model for this dataset. The model's ability to perform feature selection through L1 regularization helped in identifying the most significant predictors, thus enhancing interpretability and relevance.

## Conclusions

The model revealed that there’s a significant relationship between certain features and the target variable (diabetes progression). Specifically, BMI, serum triglycerides, and blood pressure are positively associated with increased disease progression, while HDL cholesterol and T-Cells are negatively associated. These findings provide actionable insights for managing diabetes more effectively.

### Actionable insights

- **Weight Management Programs:** Develop and promote programs focused on weight management, such as nutrition counseling, exercise regimes, and support groups to help reduce BMI.

- **Blood Pressure Monitoring**: Encourage regular blood pressure check-ups and provide resources for managing high blood pressure through lifestyle changes and medication.

- **Personalized Care:** Develop personalized treatment plans that consider the patient’s sex to optimize care and manage diabetes progression more effectively.

- **Diet and Lifestyle Adjustments:** Encourage diets rich in healthy fats, such as those found in fish, nuts, and olive oil, to increase HDL cholesterol levels. Advocate for dietary changes that lower triglyceride levels, such as reducing sugar and refined carbohydrates intake.

- **Blood Sugar Control, Education and Tools:** Provide patients with education on managing blood sugar levels, including the use of glucometers and adherence to medication.
